Credit Score Classification
There are Four credit scores that banks and credit card companies use to label their customers:

1.Excellent
2.Good
3.Standard
4.Poor
A person with a good credit score will get loans from any bank and financial institution. For the task of Credit Score Classification, we need a labelled dataset with credit scores since the credit scores is not given i have used credit numbers representing credit scores as mentioned above.

Sure, let's break down the steps for the given code:

1. *Data Preprocessing*:
   - Import necessary libraries: pandas, numpy, and sklearn's LabelEncoder for encoding categorical variables.
   - Set the default template for Plotly plots to "plotly_white" using Plotly's pio module.
   - Read the CSV file containing the dataset into a DataFrame using pd.read_csv().
   - Print the first few rows of the dataset using data.head().
   - Print information about the dataset using data.info() to understand its structure.
   - Drop columns with missing values using data.dropna(axis=1).
   - Check for missing values in the dataset using data.isnull().sum().
   - Check the distribution of the target variable (credits_no) using data["credits_no"].value_counts().

2. *Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)*:
   - Create scatter plots using Plotly Express (px.scatter()) to visualize the relationships between different features and the target variable (credits_no).

3. *Feature Engineering*:
   - Map the credit_history column to numerical values using a dictionary mapping.

4. *Splitting Data*:
   - Split the dataset into features (x) and the target variable (y).
   - Split the dataset into training and testing sets using train_test_split() from sklearn.model_selection.

5. *Model Training*:
   - Initialize a RandomForestClassifier from sklearn.ensemble.
   - Impute missing values in the training set using SimpleImputer from sklearn.impute.
   - Train the model on the training data using model.fit().

6. *Model Evaluation and Prediction*:
   - Prompt the user to input values for different features to predict the credit score.
   - Prepare the input features as a numpy array.
   - Use the trained model to predict the credit score for the given input features using model.predict().
   - Print the predicted credit score.

7. *Deployment*:
   - This code is ready to be deployed in a production environment where it can be used to predict credit scores based on new input data.

You can run this code in a Python environment such as Jupyter Notebook, Google Colab, or any IDE that supports Python. Make sure to have the necessary dependencies installed (pandas, numpy, plotly, scikit-learn) before running the code.
